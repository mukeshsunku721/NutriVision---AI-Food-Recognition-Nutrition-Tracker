# NutriVision: AI-Powered Indian Food Recognition & Nutrition Tracker

NutriVision is a full-stack AI application designed to identify various Indian food items from images and provide instant nutritional profiling (Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fats). 

The project bridges the gap between complex Indian cuisine and automated dietary tracking by leveraging State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Computer Vision and regional nutritional databases.

## 🚀 Features
- **AI Recognition:** Powered by **YOLOv8** to detect North and South Indian dishes (Idli, Dosa, Biryani, Chikki, etc.).
- **Nutritional Insights:** Real-time lookup of macro-nutrients based on the **Indian Food Composition Tables (IFCT)**.
- **Personalized Dashboard:** Track daily caloric intake against BMI-calculated requirements.
- **Fuzzy Matching Logic:** High-reliability mapping between AI labels and database entries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning:** YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), PyTorch
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Data:** Pandas, SQLite, IFCT Database
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (AJAX, Chart.js)
- **Environment:** Google Colab (Training), Local Flask Server (Deployment)

## 📊 Dataset Information
To solve the lack of diverse Indian food data, I engineered a custom dataset by merging and balancing four major Kaggle sources:
Indian Food Images (Sourav Banerjee)
Indian Food Image Dataset (Bhavik Jikadara)
5000 Indian Cuisines (CampusX)
Indian Food Nutrition (Batthula Vinay)


## 🔧 Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mukeshsunku721/NutriVision---AI-Food-Recognition-Nutrition-Tracker
   cd NutriVision-Food-Detection/flask_app
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**
    ``` bash
    python3 app.py
    ```
The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000
# 💡 Technical Implementation Details
**Model:** YOLOv8-Nano Classification chosen for the best accuracy-to-speed ratio for web deployment.

**Normalization:** Images are auto-resized to 224x224 pixels during inference.

**Logic:** Implemented a robust "Fuzzy Search" algorithm in Python to handle naming variations between the AI model and the Nutrition CSV.
# 🌟 Future Roadmap
Implementation of **YOLOv8 Detection** for multi-item plate analysis.
Volume estimation using depth sensing to calculate portion weight.
Exporting logs to PDF for medical consultations.
